Sample module "Skype":

Extract the contents of the archive "skype.tar.gz" in the examples folder in
to the modules directory. Log out and log in again and the sample module,
"Skype", will be loaded. It does not provide a tab.

This module is meant as a more complex example of the CATS Module API. You
should look at the Hello module before reviewing the Skype sample module.

The Skype module translates phone numbers on CATS pages into Skype links,
and can be enabled or disabled through the Settings tab.
