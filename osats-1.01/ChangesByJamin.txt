Changes: 10-9-2008:
Index.php 
- the code to detect whether osats has been setup will point to www/installation.php

AttachmentsReindex.php 
- Changed the code from looking for a file (Install_block) to doing the db lookup for Installed.

UI.php
- Changed the code from looking for a file (Install_block) to doing the db lookup for Installed.
AND when the setup is complete it now updates the Installed value to 1 in the db.


Changes: 10-8-2008
In the index.php file. I changed the way the site checks to see if it has been installed. Instead of looking for a file, I created a row in the db in the system table called 'Installed'. Then wrote the code to check. I include the config.php first so that the variables load.

/* Retrieve all the value from the System table to check if OSATS has been installed yet.
   * If the value is null then its false, if the value is 1 then its true.
*/
include_once('./config.php');
mysql_connect(DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASS) or die(mysql_error("No such mySQL server or incorrect username and password!"));
mysql_select_db(DATABASE_NAME) or die(mysql_error("Oops. No DB by the name: ".DATABASE_NAME));
$result = mysql_query("SELECT Installed FROM system")
or die(mysql_error("Error trying to retreive data from the System table in ".DATABASE_NAME));
$row = mysql_result( $result,'Installed' );
if ($row==null)//if the table does not have a 1 in it, then run the setup wizard.
{
    include('modules/install/notinstalled.php');
	die();
}



The following changes have been done: 10-7-2008
1. Login Page is totally different than the original CATS.
2. The CatsUtility no longer exists! I have changed the utility to OSATUTIL.php. All files now call the new utility. 
3. Cats_Version constant in Contstants.php has been changed to OSATVER. Changed Copyright_html to Company_html (this is for the footer where Cats said we couldnt change...now that its being rewritten, I made it a place for companies to put their company name and it displays it on all the footers of the pages.)
4. Removed various 'Demo' function checks. Since this is going to be Open Source, its not needed. 
5. Removed 85% of the 'CATS' remarked headings to say something along the lines of OSATS
6. Created new images and linked them up in the system. The toolbar at top has been changed by color and shape. The icon next to the links in the Administration section has been changed. The tables have been modified on the Administration section.
7. There is no need for the ASP file. I have removed all instances of it checking for the file to make it professional, it automatically loads the entire pro series items now. 
8. Removed the MRU's.  They were annoying. The code is still there, but remarked out. If you want to use it, just unremark the code.
9. Did a 85% change of instances of the name CATS and changed it to OSATS. In the code and in the DB. There are more that needs to be done though. I will continue to work on it.
10. Removed Readme from /lib/tinymce  - Not needed
    Removed changelog from /lib/tinymce  - Not needed
    Removed the entire Examples folder from /lib/tinymce
11. Changed various 'wording' in the code that gets displayed on the web pages. 
12. In areas where the Constants.php needs to be updated, I put a line that tells you where it is and displayed it on the webpage in which it belongs. (example: the footer has a blob...)

I will continue to change the code and rework it so that it is no longer considered CATSONE code. 

** If you dont like the colors, mess with the CSS files and use a graphics program to change the scheme..Later I will worry about themes, but for now.. its just getting the code out from under the license of Catsone!
