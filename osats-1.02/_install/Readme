OSATS Installation Instructions.

1. Be sure that the dbconfig.php is Writeable in the OSATS Root dir.
2. Make sure you have a mySQL server setup locally. For instructions on setting up OSATS with a server not hosted locally, stay tuned.  Currently this is only designed for local db access.
3. Have the mySQL Root password available. If you have a blank password, we recommend you set your mySQL Root account with a password first for security.
3. Enable Short Tags in PHP.ini
3. Direct your browser to the OSATS web site. The installation should automatically begin.

** You DO NOT need to create a table. The install will do this for you.
