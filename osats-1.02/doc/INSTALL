    A) Requirements

      * Linux, FreeBSD or Windows NT-based (2000, XP, 2003, Vista) Operating System
      * A working LAMP environment
      * The Antiword, PdfToText, html2text, and UnRTF document indexing tools

        Instructions on configuring a LAMP environment and setting up the
        document indexing packages are included under the sections "C) New
        Installation (Unix/Linix)" and "E) New Installation (Windows)".



    B) New Installation (Unix/Linix) - Quick

        This "quick install" section is only intended for advanced users and
        users that have installed OSATS before and just need a quick overview.
        New users and non-advanced users are advised to read the in depth
        install instructions in part C) New Installation - In Depth instead
        of this section.

        1)  Unpack the tarball into the web directory (/var/www/html,
            /usr/local/apache2/htdocs, or similar). Make a symlink to
            OSATS-0.9.1/ or rename the OSATS-0.9.1/ directory to OSATS/.
        2)  Start MySQL as the root user and create a new database and username.
              mysql> CREATE DATABASE OSATS;
              mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `OSATS`.* TO  'OSATS'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
        3)  Make sure that the web server has permission to write to the
            attachments directory.
              # chown apache:apache OSATS
              # chown -R apache:apache OSATS-x.x.x/
              # chmod 770 OSATS/attachments
        4)  Visit installwizard.php from a browser to invoke the installer. *
        5)  Follow the on-screen instructions.

        * Tip: If the installer does not load, check to see if there is a file
          called 'INSTALL_BLOCK' in the OSATS directory. Delete it to allow the
          installer to be executed.



    C)  New Installation (Unix/Linux) - In Depth

        THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR USERS OF A LINUX OR UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM. For installation
        instructions for Windows, read part E) Installation Instructions (Windows)

      Prerequisites:

          * MySQL Daemon 4.1 (or greater) [ www.mysql.org/ ]
          * PHP 5.x w/ MySQL Module [ www.php.net/ ]
          * PHP GD2 Module [ http://www.boutell.com/gd/ ] ***
          * Apache HTTP Daemon [ www.apache.org/ ]
          * Antiword [ www.winfield.demon.nl/ ]
          * PdfToText [ http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/ ]
          * html2text [ http://www.mbayer.de/html2text/ ]
          * UnRTF [ http://www.gnu.org/software/unrtf/unrtf.html ]

          The OSATS team recommends Ubuntu Server Edition for hosting OSATS.

                http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download

          Ubuntu Server comes preconfigured with MySQL, PHP, and Apache.  To
          install GD2 under Ubuntu, execute:

                sudo apt-get install php5-gd

          For instructions on downlading and installing Antiword, PdfToText,
          html2text, and UnRTF visit:

                http://www.OSATSone.com/resumeIndexingSoftware.php?server_software=&os=LIST

      1) Unpack tarball (OSATS-0.9.1.tar.gz) under your apache document root
         (/var/www/html, /usr/local/apache2/htdocs, /cygdrive/c/wamp/www,
         or similar) and create a symlink to it named 'OSATS':

         # cd /var/www/html
         # tar zxvf OSATS-0.9.1.tar.gz
         # ln -s OSATS-0.9.1 OSATS

      2) Launch MySQL client and create a new database and user.

         # mysql -uroot -p
         mysql> CREATE DATABASE OSATS;
         mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `OSATS`.* TO  'OSATS'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
         mysql> EXIT;

      3) Change ownership of the installation directory to the user and group
         that your web server runs under. This is usually 'apache', 'nobody',
         or 'www' (you can do a ps -auxww to see what user your web server is
         running as).

         # chown apache:apache OSATS
         # chown -R apache:apache OSATS-x.x.x/
         # chmod 770 OSATS/attachments

      4) Preform any necessary apache configuration changes so that the
         installation is accessible from a web browser (aliases, virtual hosts,
         etc.). See apache documentation for how to do this.

      5) In a web browser, visit the OSATS installer page inside the OSATS web
         directory to finish the installation process: *

         http://mydomain.com/OSATS/installwizard.php

         (Replacing 'mydomain.com' with your domain name, or the ip address
         of your server)

          * Tip: If the installer does not load, check to see if there is a file
            called 'INSTALL_BLOCK' in the OSATS directory. Delete it to allow the
            installer to be executed.

      6) Follow the installer directions to complete the installation.

         If any tests do not pass, check your configuration and requirements
         fulfillment and refresh the page (hold down shift while refreshing
         for Firefox and IE to ensure a refresh). You may visit the forum
         on http://www.OSATSone.com/ for support.

      7) OSATS should now be up and running. Enjoy! Remember to visit
         http://www.OSATSone.com/ and participate in the forum.




    D) Upgrading from an Earlier Version (Unix/Linux) - In Depth

        THESE INSTRCUTIONS ARE FOR USERS OF A LINUX OR UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM. For installation
        instructions for Windows, read part F) Upgrading from an Earlier Version (Windows)

     1) Unpack tarball (OSATS-0.9.1.tar.gz) under your apache document root
        (/var/www/html, /usr/local/apache2/htdocs or similar).

        # cd /var/www/html
        # tar zxvf OSATS-0.9.1.tar.gz

     2) Back up the 'OSATS' database by issuing the following command at
        your shell prompt:

        # mysqldump -uroot -p OSATS > ~/OSATS-backup.sql
        (enter the password you created for the 'OSATS' user during install
         when prompted to do so)

        Please note that this backup can not be restored by the interactive
        OSATS installer - it is a failsafe incase the upgrade fails and the
        database becomes corrupt. If you later need to restore the database
        from this backup, you can issue the command:

        # mysql -uroot -p OSATS < ~/OSATS-backup.sql

     3) Remove the 'OSATS' symlink (DO NOT USE rm -rf; this would delete all
        of your attachments. USE rm WITH NO COMMAND LINE OPTIONS!):

        # rm OSATS

     4) Copy the attachments/ directory from OSATS-x.x.x/ to OSATS-0.9.1/:

        Linux:
        # cp -p -r OSATS-x.x.x/attachments/ OSATS-0.9.1/

        FreeBSD:
        # cp -p -R OSATS-x.x.x/attachments/ OSATS-0.9.1/

        Where x.x.x is your older version number of OSATS.

     5) Create a symlink to the OSATS-0.9.1 directory:

        # ln -s OSATS-0.9.1 OSATS

     6) Change ownership of the installation directory to the user and group
        that your web server runs under. This is usually 'apache', 'nobody',
        or 'www' (you can do a ps -auxww to see what user your web server is
        running as).

        # chown apache:apache OSATS
        # chown -R apache:apache OSATS-0.9.1/

     7) In a web browser, visit the OSATS installer page inside the OSATS web
        directory to finish the installation process: *

        http://mydomain.com/OSATS/installwizard.php

        (Replacing 'mydomain.com' with your domain name, or the ip address
        of your server)

         * Tip: If the installer does not load, check to see if there is a file
           called 'INSTALL_BLOCK' in the OSATS directory. Delete it to allow the
           installer to be executed.

     8) Follow the installer directions to complete the installation. Your
        database schema will be upgraded automatically.

        If any tests do not pass, check your configuration and requirements
        fulfillment and refresh the page (hold down shift while refreshing
        for Firefox and IE to ensure a refresh). You may visit the forum
        on http://www.OSATSone.com/ for support.

     9) OSATS should now be up and running. Enjoy! Remember to visit
        http://www.OSATSone.com/ and participate in the forum.




    E) New Installation (Windows)

      Prerequisites:

          * WAMP [ http://www.wampserver.com/en/ ]
          * Resume Indexing Tools [ http://www.OSATSone.com/indexingTools/setupResumeIndexingTools.exe ]
          * WinRAR [ http://www.rarlab.com/ ]

           - OR (Power Users) -

          * MySQL Daemon 4.1 (or greater) [ www.mysql.org/ ]
          * PHP 5.x w/ MySQL Module [ www.php.net/ ]
          * PHP GD2 Module [ http://www.boutell.com/gd/ ] ***
          * Apache HTTP Daemon [ www.apache.org/ ]
          * Antiword [ www.winfield.demon.nl/ ]
          * PdfToText [ http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/ ]
          * html2text [ http://www.mbayer.de/html2text/ ]
          * UnRTF [ http://www.gnu.org/software/unrtf/unrtf.html ]
          * A tool to extract tar.gz files

           Installation instructions are given for the WAMP environment only.

     1) Open tarball (OSATS-0.9.1.tar.gz) under WinRAR and extract all files
        to c:\wamp\www (or your web server's document root folder).

     2) Launch phpMyAdmin by clicking on the WAMP icon in your system tray and
        selecting phpMyAdmin.  A web browser will open.  In the page that displays,
        type 'OSATS' into the textbox under Create new database and click the Create button.

     3) Enable GD2 by clicking on the WAMP icon in your system tray and selecting
        'PHP settings' followed by 'PHP extensions', and selecting 'php_gd2'.

     4) Bring your WAMP server online by clicking on the WAMP icon in your system
        tray and selecting 'Put Online'.

     5) In a Web Browser, visit http://localhost/OSATS-0.9.1/ .  If OSATS has been
        configured correctly, you should see a page that says:

        OSATS has not yet been installed, or a previous installation was not completed.
                    Please visit the Installation Wizard to continue.

        Follow the link to the Installation Wizard to complete installation.  When
        asked for database name, user, and password use database 'OSATS', user 'root',
        and a blank password.




    F) Upgrading from an Earlier Version (Windows)

     1) Open tarball (OSATS-0.9.1.tar.gz) and extract all files
        to c:\wamp\www (or your web server's document root folder).

     2) Launch phpMyAdmin by clicking on the WAMP icon in your system tray and
        selecting phpMyAdmin.  A web browser will open.

        On the dropdown menu under Database on the left, Choose 'OSATS'.

        Select the 'Export' tab.

        Check 'Save as File' at the bottom of the window and press 'Go'.  Download
        and put the resulting SQL file somewhere safe on your computer.
        you will need this file to restore your database in the event
        something goes wrong during the upgrade process.

     3) Copy the attachments folder from your previous installation of OSATS
        into your new installation of OSATS.  For example, if you installed
        OSATS 0.8.0 in c:\wamp\www\OSATS-0.8.0, move c:\wamp\www\OSATS-0.8.0\attachments
        to c:\wamp\www\OSATS-0.9.1\attachments.

     4) In a Web Browser, visit http://localhost/OSATS-0.9.1/ .  If OSATS has been
        configured correctly, you should see a page that says:

        OSATS has not yet been installed, or a previous installation was not completed.
                    Please visit the Installation Wizard to continue.

        Follow the link to the Installation Wizard to complete installation.




    G) Advanced OSATS Add-ons

        For advanced users, OSATS has a few special features which can be
        manually installed.

     1) Sphinx Indexing [ http://www.sphinxsearch.com/ ]:
        OSATS can integrate with the advanced Sphinx to dramatically improve
        the speed which indexed documents are searched (more than 200x speed
        improvement).  To learn how to integrate with the Sphinx engine, visit
        the OSATS forums at http://www.OSATSone.com/forum/.

     2) Scheduled E-Mail reminders
        OSATS can send out E-Mail reminders for calendar events before they happen.
        To enable this feature, configure cron or another scheduling daemon to
        invoke QueueCLI.php every minute.  An example crontab line would look like:

            * * * * * /usr/local/bin/php /var/www/html/OSATS/QueueCLI.php

        Or,

            * * * * * curl http://mysite.com/QueueCLI.php > /dev/null

     3) CLI / On demand backups
        OSATS can generate a backup from the command line on Unix systems.  If the
        Unix zip utility is installed, then you can execute:

        php scripts/makeBackup.php 1

        from the OSATS root directory to generate a backup in scrips/backup/OSATSbackup.bak.

        This, combined with a script to rotate backups which was executed from
        cron, could yield automated backups.

     4) OSATS attachments layout upgrade
        All new OSATS attachments bury themselves a few more levels down in the
        attachments folder.  If you are upgrading from a previous 0.7.1 installation
        of OSATS and want OSATS to reorganize your attachments folder to follow the
        new organization pattern, log in as an administrator and visit:

            ajax.php?f=install:attachmentsToThreeDirectory

    H)  Integration with Sphinx

        As of OSATS 0.9.1 Sphinx integration is available via separate package.
        Sphinx speeds up text-based database searches considerably.
