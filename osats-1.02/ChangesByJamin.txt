Removed the license issue.  No need to register or put the license key in the Config.php.
I have remarked out various license functions from files. I have not deleted them yet as I am still testing functionality.
If you have any comments.. please notify me!

Previous mods:
---------------
The following changes have been done.
1. Login Page is totally different than the original CATS.
2. The CatsUtility no longer exists! I have changed the utility to OSATUTIL.php. All files now call the new utility. 
3. Cats_Version constant in Contstants.php has been changed to OSATVER. Changed Copyright_html to Company_html (this is for the footer where Cats said we couldnt change...now that its being rewritten, I made it a place for companies to put their company name and it displays it on all the footers of the pages.)
4. Removed various 'Demo' function checks. Since this is going to be Open Source, its not needed. 
5. Removed 85% of the 'CATS' remarked headings to say something along the lines of OSATS
6. Created new images and linked them up in the system. The toolbar at top has been changed by color and shape. The icon next to the links in the Administration section has been changed. The tables have been modified on the Administration section.
7. There is no need for the ASP file. I have removed all instances of it checking for the file to make it professional, it automatically loads the entire pro series items now. 
8. Removed the MRU's.  They were annoying. The code is still there, but remarked out. If you want to use it, just unremark the code.
9. Did a 85% change of instances of the name CATS and changed it to OSATS. In the code and in the DB. There are more that needs to be done though. I will continue to work on it.
10. Removed Readme from /lib/tinymce  - Not needed
    Removed changelog from /lib/tinymce  - Not needed
    Removed the entire Examples folder from /lib/tinymce
11. Changed various 'wording' in the code that gets displayed on the web pages. 
12. In areas where the Constants.php needs to be updated, I put a line that tells you where it is and displayed it on the webpage in which it belongs. (example: the footer has a blob...)

I will continue to change the code and rework it so that it is no longer considered CATSONE code. 

** If you dont like the colors, mess with the CSS files and use a graphics program to change the scheme..Later I will worry about themes, but for now.. its just getting the code out from under the license of Catsone!
